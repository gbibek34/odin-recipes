        After the cloves start to spurt out the ghee add in the chopped carrots.

        Let the carrots fry in the ghee for a while and then add sugar according

        Cover the cookware and let it cook until the carrots are boiled enough
        to smash and the milk is reduced as well
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, smash the carrots and add in some dry fruits like cashews and
        almonds

      <li>
        Store the hot carrot pudding in a container and keep it in the fridge
