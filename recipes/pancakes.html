    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      A pancake is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a
      starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter, and then
      cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan. It is a type of
      batter bread.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start by preparing the batter for pancake. Take a cup of flour, add
        sugar and salt to your taste, add a teaspoon of baking powder and mix
      </li>
      <li>
        Further, add a cup of milk and start whisking the mixture leaving no air
        bubbles. Add eggs and vanilla extract and start whisking again until you
        have a smooth batter ready to go.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take a pan and heat it, add some butter to it (enough for a pancake to
        cook).
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in a small amount of batter (According to the size of pancake you
        want) and let it cook until it bubbles upwards and the runny batter
        start to solidify.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flip the pancake once it has no runny batter on top and cook it until
        both the sides start looking light brown
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally stack the pancakes and add in some honey or butter on top of
        them. You can enjoy them with some dry fruits or berries on the side.
